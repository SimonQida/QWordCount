How to use the elegant tiny QC?

  open your cmd and cd to the folder having Conder.exe.
  
  code in 
  
    Conder.exe [parameter] [input_file_name] [parameter] [output_file_name]
    
  -c -w -l for parameters before input_file_name and -o before output_file_name
  
  perhaps you want to analyse one more files.And it's ok in my program.
  
   you can also output some message into file1 and some into file2.
   
   you can test it by taking LICENSE as input_file_name or your added new files
